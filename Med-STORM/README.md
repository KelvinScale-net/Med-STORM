**Med-STORM** (Systematic, Trustworthy, Open, and Reliable Medicine) is an advanced AI-powered medical research assistant designed to revolutionize evidence-based medicine by automating systematic literature reviews and clinical decision support.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Literature Search**: Aggregates and analyzes medical literature from trusted sources including PubMed, clinical guidelines, and pre-print servers.
- **Evidence Synthesis**: Automatically synthesizes findings from multiple studies with proper source attribution.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Provides evidence-based recommendations with confidence scoring.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Generates treatment recommendations tailored to individual patient factors.
- **Evidence Grading**: Classifies evidence by confidence levels (Tier 1-3) for better decision-making.
- **Streaming Search**: Processes large result sets efficiently with streaming support.
- **Advanced Deduplication**: Removes duplicate and near-duplicate evidence using multiple algorithms.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Generates structured comparison tables for evidence evaluation.
- **Executive Summaries**: Produces detailed, structured summaries of research findings.
- **Transparent Methodology**: Complete traceability of information sources and reasoning process.
- **Customizable Search Parameters**: Fine-tune search criteria based on study types, publication dates, and evidence levels.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/med-storm.git
   cd med-storm
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

```python
from med_storm import MedStorm

# Initialize the research engine
engine = MedStorm(
    openai_api_key="your_openai_key",  # or set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
    serper_api_key="your_serper_key"    # or set SERPER_API_KEY in .env
)

# Conduct a medical literature review
results = engine.research(
    query="Efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction",
    max_sources=10,
    study_types=["rct", "meta-analysis"],
    min_publication_year=2018
)

# Generate a structured report
report = results.generate_report(format="markdown")
print(report)
```

## üìÇ Project Architecture

Med-STORM is built on a modular architecture that combines multiple AI components:

1. **Search Module**: Utilizes Serper API for web search and PubMed E-utilities for academic literature.
2. **LLM Integration**: Leverages DeepSeek models for content analysis and synthesis.
3. **Evidence Processing**: Implements a multi-stage pipeline for source evaluation and evidence grading.
4. **Report Generation**: Creates structured, referenced reports with proper citations.

```

## üîç Technical Stack

- **Core Language**: Python 3.9+
- **LLM Framework**: DeepSeek API (with OpenAI API compatibility layer)
- **Search**: Serper API, PubMed E-utilities
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI (for future web interface)
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov
- **Documentation**: Sphinx, ReadTheDocs

## üß™ Testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Running the Enhanced Engine

To run the enhanced Med-STORM engine with all the new features:

```python
from med_storm.core.engine_enhanced import EnhancedStormEngine
from med_storm.llm.providers.openai import OpenAIChatProvider
from med_storm.connectors.pubmed import PubMedConnector

# Initialize components
llm_provider = OpenAIChatProvider(api_key="your_openai_key")
connector = PubMedConnector(email="your_email@example.com")

# Initialize enhanced engine
engine = EnhancedStormEngine(
    llm_provider=llm_provider,
    knowledge_connectors=[connector],
    # ... other components
)

# Run with patient factors
patient_factors = [
    {"name": "age", "value": "65", "type": "demographic"},
    {"name": "diabetes", "value": "Type 2", "type": "comorbidity"}
]

results = await engine.run_enhanced_storm(
    topic="Treatment of type 2 diabetes in elderly patients",
    patient_factors=patient_factors
)
```

### Key Features in Action

1. **Personalized Medicine**:
   ```python
   recommendations = await engine.generate_personalized_recommendations(
       corpus=evidence_corpus,
       patient_factors=patient_factors,
       condition="Type 2 Diabetes"
   )
   ```

2. **Evidence Summary with Tables**:
   ```python
2. **Personalized Medicine Engine**: Handles patient-specific recommendations
3. **Deduplication Module**: Removes duplicate content using multiple algorithms
4. **Comparison Tables**: Generates structured evidence comparisons
5. **Streaming Support**: For efficient processing of large result sets

## üìà Performance

- **Faster Searches**: Up to 2x faster with streaming
- **Better Relevance**: Improved result ranking and filtering
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Advanced deduplication
- **Scalable**: Handles large result sets efficiently
