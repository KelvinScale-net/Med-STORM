1. Evidence Collection Strategy
------------------------------

1.1 Multi-Tiered Evidence Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision**: Implemented a three-tiered evidence collection system with explicit confidence levels for each source.

**Rationale**:
- Provides transparency about source reliability
- Allows for flexible weighting of evidence in synthesis
- Enables users to understand the strength of recommendations
- Follows best practices in evidence-based medicine

**Implementation**:
- Tier 1: Peer-reviewed literature (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Tier 2: Reputable guidelines and pre-prints
- Tier 3: Other high-quality secondary sources

1.2 Source Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Focused on PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov as primary sources before considering web search.

**Rationale**:
- PubMed provides access to peer-reviewed, high-quality medical literature
- ClinicalTrials.gov offers comprehensive data on ongoing and completed trials
- Reduces noise from less reliable web sources
- Aligns with medical research best practices

2. Technology Stack
------------------

2.1 DeepSeek over OpenAI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Switched from OpenAI to DeepSeek API for LLM capabilities.

**Rationale**:
- Better performance on medical domain tasks
- More cost-effective for research purposes
- Open weights model available for self-hosting
- Comparable performance on medical QA benchmarks

2.2 Serper over DuckDuckGo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Replaced DuckDuckGo with Serper for web search.

**Rationale**:
- More reliable API with consistent results
- Better handling of academic and medical queries
- Higher rate limits for research purposes
- More structured response format

3. Architecture Decisions
-----------------------

3.1 Modular Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Implemented a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Components**:
- Connectors: Interface with external APIs
- Processors: Handle data transformation and analysis
- Models: Define data structures and business logic
- Utils: Shared utility functions

**Benefits**:
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Better code organization
- Simplified feature additions
- Clear boundaries between components

3.2 Asynchronous Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Used Python's asyncio for concurrent API calls.

**Rationale**:
- Improved performance for I/O-bound operations
- Better resource utilization
- More responsive user experience
- Scalable for batch processing

4. Evidence Processing Pipeline
------------------------------

4.1 Multi-Stage Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Implemented a multi-stage validation process for all evidence.

**Stages**:
1. Source validation (authenticity, retractions)
2. Evidence grading (GRADE methodology)
3. Contradiction detection

**Benefits**:
- Higher quality evidence synthesis
- Reduced risk of misinformation
- Transparent assessment process

4.2 Confidence Scoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Implemented a transparent confidence scoring system.

**Factors Considered**:
- Source reliability (journal impact factor, publisher)
- Study design (RCT > cohort > case-control > expert opinion)
- Sample size and statistical power
- Risk of bias assessment
- Publication date and relevance

5. User Experience
-----------------

5.1 Transparent Sourcing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: All sources are clearly cited with confidence levels.

**Implementation**:
- Inline citations in generated reports
- Visual indicators of evidence strength
- Direct links to original sources
- Clear separation of different evidence tiers

5.2 Customizable Search Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Allowed users to customize search parameters.

**Options**:
- Publication date ranges
- Study types (RCTs, meta-analyses, etc.)
- Minimum evidence tier
- Language filters

6. Performance Optimizations
--------------------------

6.1 Caching Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Implemented a multi-level caching system.

**Layers**:
1. In-memory cache for API responses
2. Disk cache for processed evidence
3. Query result caching

**Benefits**:
- Reduced API calls
- Faster response times
- Lower operational costs

6.2 Rate Limiting and Backoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Implemented intelligent rate limiting and exponential backoff.

**Implementation**:
- Respects API rate limits
- Implements jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Graceful degradation under load

7. Security and Privacy
---------------------

7.1 Data Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: No storage of sensitive or personal data.

**Implementation**:
- All processing is stateless
- No persistent storage of user queries
- Secure API key management

7.2 Secure Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Enforced HTTPS for all external communications.

**Implementation**:
- Certificate pinning
- TLS 1.2+ requirement
- Regular security audits

8. Testing Strategy
------------------

8.1 Test Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Maintain high test coverage with focus on critical paths.

**Targets**:
- 90%+ unit test coverage
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

8.2 Mocking Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Used extensive mocking for external services.

**Benefits**:
- Reliable test execution
- No dependency on external services
- Faster test execution
- Consistent test results

9. Documentation
---------------

9.1 Comprehensive Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Decision**: Invested in thorough documentation.

**Components**:
- API reference
- User guides
- Developer guides
- Architecture decision records

**Benefits**:
- Easier onboarding
- Better maintainability
- Clear contribution guidelines

10. Future Considerations
-----------------------

10.1 Planned Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Support for additional evidence sources
- Integration with EHR systems
- Advanced visualization of evidence networks
- Automated systematic review generation

10.2 Research Directions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Few-shot learning for better evidence synthesis
- Automated risk of bias assessment
- Real-time evidence updates
- Multi-modal evidence integration (text, tables, figures)
